Webisoget is a web page retrieval program that will 
follow redirections and frames, and will submit
and follow forms.  It can be used to access
pubcookie and shibboleth protected pages.

See the user documentation in webisoget.man
or in webisoget.html

The library and includes are installed as well
as the executable.  You can use them in your
c programs.  Use webisoget.c as a guide to the API.
